# Notebooks

This directory stores the Jupyter notebooks used to fit models and generate figures. An overview of the purpose of each notebook can be found below:
* `create_rate_estimates.ipynb` calculates ground truth parameters from laboratory measurements.
* `flowcytometry_analysis.ipynb` converts flow cytometry data into particle size distributions used for model fitting.
* `fit_models.ipynb` fits the nine model formulations to the 48-hour laboratory culture dataset and outputs the results analyzed in the manuscript. This notebook is computationally expensive and is best run overnight.
* `figures.ipynb` uses the results output by `fit_models.ipynb` to generate the figures for the manuscript.
* `rolling_window.ipynb` implements the perturbation analysis detailed in the manuscript. This notebook is extremely computationally expensive and is best run using a remote cluster.
* `figures_rolling_window.ipynb` uses the results generated by `rolling_window.ipynb` to produce the corresponding figures in the manuscript.
